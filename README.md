Future Orientation Tweets.
Replication Guide.

Unfortunately, due to Twitter code 
FIRST. Get a twitter developer account it's easy. Just follow this. 

We used the package rtweet. Unfortunately, we can only provide the ID of the tweets due to the [twitter developer policy] (https://gwu-libraries.github.io/sfm-ui/posts/2017-09-14-twitter-data), not the tweets themselves. Unfortunately we deleted these on accident.
