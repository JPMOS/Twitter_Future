Future Orientation Tweets.
Replication Guide.

Unfortunately, due to Twitter code 
FIRST. Get a twitter developer account it's easy. Just follow this. 

We used the package rtweet. Unfortunately, we can only provide the ID of the tweets due to the [twitter developer policy] (https://gwu-libraries.github.io/sfm-ui/posts/2017-09-14-twitter-data), not the tweets themselves. Unfortunately we deleted these on accident. 

When starting to scrape data from Twitter, there are two things that need to be done. First is to set up a Twitter account and second is to request a Twitter token to get access to the API through this link https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/basics/authentication/guides/access-tokens.

A request is simple and Twitter responds very quickly. Simply fill out what your purpose is for the token and the turn around time is very quick.
